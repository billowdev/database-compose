### Explanation

- .PHONY: Declares the targets as phony to ensure they aren't confused with actual file names.
- DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE: Variable defining the path to your ScyllaDB Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yaml).
- up, down, restart, logs: Targets to start (up), stop (down), restart (restart), and view logs (logs) of the ScyllaDB Docker containers using docker-compose.
- scylla-target: This target allows you to run any specific command (up, down, restart, logs, etc.) by passing the commands to docker-compose using $(filter-out $@,$(MAKECMDGOALS)).
- %:: This is a pattern rule that acts as a catch-all for targets not explicitly defined (up, down, restart, logs, etc.). The @: ensures that if no specific target is matched, it silently does nothing (@ suppresses the output of the command).
